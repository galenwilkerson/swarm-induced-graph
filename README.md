# Swarm-Induced Graph - Oil Spill Cleanup

Using 'robot' positions at each timestep, compute pair-wise distances.
Robots within a threshold distance of one another can communicate.

* The first part of the notebook uses a file "example_freeze" containing robot locations at each timestep, generated by an external C++ program. (using liquidfun robotics swarm by Calum Emrie, University of Edinburgh)


* The second part of the notebook uses numpy to create a vectorized swarm simulation.  There are robots and oil particles.  Both move randomly.  At the moment, there is no interaction between robots and oil.
